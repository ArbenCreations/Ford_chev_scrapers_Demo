incomplete,Driver’s Front Seat Belt Anchor Pretensioner Cable,,2019-03-06,"Certain 2011-2012 model year Chevrolet Malibu vehicles were previously involved in safety recall 15031, “Safety Belt Lap Anchor Tensioner Cable”. In these vehicles, if a driver repeatedly sits on the seat belt cable cover located at the base of the driver’s seat when entering the vehicle, it may cause the seat belt pretensioner to bend sharply over the seat side shield. If this continues to occur over an extended period of time, which is very rare, the seat belt pretensioner cable may fatigue and eventually separate, which could reduce the effectiveness of the vehicle’s seat belts.  Before any damage occurs to the pretensioner cable itself, signs of wear will be visible on the pretensioner cable cover where it has been repeatedly bent over the seat side shield.

The condition is more prevalent at low speed when softly applying the brakes. The engine mounted mechanical vacuum pump output may decrease over time decreasing the amount of vacuum/power brake assist. Failure to follow recommended oil change intervals could contribute to this condition. The Driver’s Information Center, (DIC) “Service brake assist” alert will activate 2-5 minutes after the vacuum level drops, and a Diagnostic Trouble Code, (DTC) will also be set.

If a ball joint were to separate, one or both of the windshield wipers could become inoperative, which could limit the driver’s visibility under certain operating conditions which may increase the risk of a crash causing injury and/or damage to property.  The predominant failure mode is water draining through the Air Inlet Panel (AIP) onto the wiper transmission ball joints, leading to grease washout of the link ball sockets.  As the grease washes out of the transmission ball joint sockets, contaminants are able to enter the joints causing corrosion and wear of the link ball and socket, resulting in a reduced retention force of the joint.

In these vehicles, if a driver repeatedly sits on the seat belt cable cover located at the base of the driver’s seat when entering the vehicle, it may cause the seat belt pretensioner to bend sharply over the seat side shield. If this continues to occur over an extended period of time, which is very rare, the seat belt pretensioner cable may fatigue and eventually separate, which could reduce the effectiveness of the vehicle’s seat belts.  Before any damage occurs to the pretensioner cable itself, signs of wear will be visible on the pretensioner cable cover where it has been repeatedly bent over the seat side shield.
